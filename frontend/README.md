Frontend (Next.js) for VisionBharatSphere

Quick start

1. Install dependencies and run dev server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

2. Visit http://localhost:3000 and open the Ishihara test page.

Notes
- This is a minimal scaffold. The `ishihara` page demonstrates the same preloaded plates and options and can be extended to call the backend endpoints.
- For production on Vercel, deploy the frontend to Vercel and deploy the backend to Render/Railway or another host, then set environment variables for API base URL and JWT secret.
